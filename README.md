It has been always said that you should never ask a girl her age ,but what if you had a program who would guess it for you.Wouldn't that be fun and easy at the same time.


a simple and fun game in c language
genrate a random number from 1-100,or we can change it to 1-1000 by replacing the 100 to 1000 in code
the user has to guess it
if the user guesses higher number than the random number,program shows lower number please(age in change of number)
if the user guesses lower number than the random number,program shows higher number please(age in change of number)
and at last when the guessd number matches, program shows the number of guesses it took you to correctly get the number
